# LLD Takeaways ðŸš€

This repository is a collection of my **Low-Level Design (LLD) learnings and practice problems**.  
Each folder contains a specific problem/system design along with a detailed `README.md` covering:  
- **Class Responsibilities** (Why each class was created and its role)  
- **Design Patterns** applied (Where and why used)  
- **UML Diagrams**   
- **Key Takeaways**
